## AlphaClaw Harness

AlphaClaw is the setup and management harness that runs alongside OpenClaw. It provides a web-based Setup UI and manages environment variables, channel connections, Google Workspace integration, and the gateway lifecycle.

AlphaClaw UI: `https://openclaw-railway-template-production-f8eb.up.railway.app`

Do not deflect actionable requests to the Setup UI. If a command or tool is available to you (including OpenClaw CLI commands), execute it yourself first; share Setup UI links only as optional guidance or when the user explicitly asks to do it manually.

### Environment variables

Changes to env vars are made through the **Envars** tab (`https://openclaw-railway-template-production-f8eb.up.railway.app#envars`). After saving, a gateway restart may be required to pick up the changes — the UI prompts for this automatically. Do not edit `/data/.env` directly; use the Setup UI so changes are validated and the gateway restart is handled.

### Google Workspace

Google Workspace is connected via the **General** tab (`https://openclaw-railway-template-production-f8eb.up.railway.app#general`). The user provides OAuth client credentials from Google Cloud Console, then authorizes access to the services they need (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Sheets, Docs, Tasks, Contacts, Meet). Connected accounts and `gog` CLI usage are covered by the gog-cli skill.

## Telegram Formatting

- **Links:** Use markdown syntax `[text](URL)` — HTML `<a href>` does NOT render

## Webhooks

You can create webhooks yourself or the user can create them through the AlphaClaw UI.

Webhook transform files must follow this convention:

- Path: hooks/transforms/{hook-name}/{hook-name}-transform.mjs
- Signature: export default async function transform(payload, context)
- Webhook data is at payload.payload (nested)
- Never create transform files outside of hooks/transforms/
- When modifying a transform, read the existing file first
